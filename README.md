# Supermarket-Pricing
Supermarket Pricing is a tiny project that focuses on developer's technical skills rather than functional requirements. 
It aims to evaluate developer's capacities in regard with three concerns:
Project structure and modeling.
The use of TDD method.
The use of pertinent Java 8 techniques.
